# Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing a **predictive model** to assess the **credit risk** of loan applicants in a multifinance company. By leveraging **historical loan data from 2007 to 2014**, the model aims to classify borrowers into **good** or **bad** credit risk categories.

## üìä Project Overview

The objective of this project is to support financial decision-making by automating the credit risk evaluation process using machine learning. The project follows a complete **data science pipeline**, consisting of:

- **Data Understanding**
